# Applied LaTeX for Researchers

This repository holds the materials for the LaTeX workshop (March 7th, 2025).

## Building the Examples

The source files for the workshop are located in `scripts/` and `slides/`.
To compile them into PDFs you can run:

```bash
pdflatex scripts/main.tex
pdflatex slides/latex_lecture.tex
```

Ensure that a LaTeX distribution such as TeX&nbsp;Live is installed before running these commands.

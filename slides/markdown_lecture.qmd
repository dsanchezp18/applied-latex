# Markdown

## Markdown

- Markdown is a _lightweight markup language_
    - Means that, unlike \LaTeX or html \ it is not a programming language
    - Overall, known for its simplicity and readability, both in its raw form and rendered form

- Markdown is widely used in coding-related applications, such as:
    - GitHub
    - Jupyter Notebooks/Google Colab
    - R Markdown/Quarto
    - Stack Overflow
    - Slack
    - Notion/Obsidian
    - Reddit!

## Markdown Syntax

- We've already talked about some basic Markdown syntax:
    - Headers use `#`
    - Lists use `-` or `1.`
    - Emphasis uses `*` or `_`
    - Links use `[text](url)`

- There are many more elements in Markdown, such as:
    - Images
    - Tables
    - Blockquotes
    - Code blocks
    - Footnotes
    - And more!

- You can consult the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for more information

## Markdown flavours

- Markdown has "flavours" or "dialects" that add extra functionality
    - GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)
    - CommonMark
    - Pandoc Markdown
    - Markdown Extra
    - And more!

- These flavours add extra functionality, such as:
    - Tables
    - Footnotes
    - Strikethrough
    - Task lists
    - And more!

- The most common is GFM, which is what we'll be using today
    - See the [GitHub Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet) for more info

## Compilation of Markdown

- In RMarkdown and Quarto, Markdown text is compiled through Pandoc
    - Pandoc is a universal document converter
    
- We do not need to understand much about the internal workings of Pandoc

- But know that Markdown can be used and compiled without any major software
    - Use VS Code (with the Markdown Preview Enhanced and Markdown All in One extensions)
